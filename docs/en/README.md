# auto-suggest-java-demo

## Overview  
This project implements an interactive dictionary system based on a Trie data structure (similar to an input method's predictive word library), with its core focus on addressing efficiency and accuracy issues in text input scenarios. Leveraging the Trie tree's high-performance prefix-matching capabilities, it delivers three key functionalities: word storage, auto-completion, and spelling suggestions, making it suitable for applications such as dictionary maintenance and input method optimization. The architecture adopts a monolithic design, with core resources including the Trie data structure and the edit distance algorithm, relying on the Java standard library for lightweight deployment. For example, it uses a Map to store child node relationships and combines Scanner for console interaction, forming a self-contained tool-based solution.

## What is auto-suggest-java-demo?  
This system integrates two major modules: Trie tree construction (similar to letter combinations on a telephone keypad) and intelligent querying. The Trie class is responsible for dynamically maintaining the tree structure, while the Main class handles user interaction. Technically, it employs character-level hierarchical matching for prefix searches (e.g., inputting "app" locates the "apple" branch) and generates spelling suggestions using the edit distance algorithm (akin to fuzzy search). Typical application templates include educational tools for word learning (real-time error correction) and developer assistance tools (code completion). In the implementation, the TrieNode's isEndOfWord flag marks termination nodes, which, combined with depth-first traversal, enables completion suggestions, forming a closed-loop text processing workflow.
